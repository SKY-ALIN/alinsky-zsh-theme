# My daily theme for zsh shell

![Demo](demo.png)

| Feature               | Description                                                                                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Git** | Branch status with visual indicators for modified/untracked files                            |
| **Timer**     | Execution time tracking (only >1s commands) in purple segment                                |
| **Timestamp** | Right prompt shows exact command start time (when you press Enter), not initial render time â€” perfect for activity logs |

## Installation:

Make sure you already installed [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), it's required for this theme.

If you use curl:

```shell
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SKY-ALIN/zsh-theme/refs/heads/main/install.zsh | zsh
```

If you use wget:

```shell
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SKY-ALIN/zsh-theme/refs/heads/main/install.zsh | zsh
```

Both commands will copy the theme code onto your machine, update .zshrc file and launch it. If you don't see the result, reboot your terminal.
