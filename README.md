# My daily theme for zsh shell

![Demo](demo.png)

## Features

* Git bransh and its status
* Execution timer
* Run time - after you press the `Enter` button and run a command, the theme will update the right prompt. So, the time on the right is not the time when it's rendered the first time, that's the time when a command is entered. Very useful for logs.

## Installation:

If you use curl:

```shell
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SKY-ALIN/alinsky-zsh-theme/refs/heads/main/install.zsh | zsh
```

If you use wget:

```shell
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SKY-ALIN/alinsky-zsh-theme/refs/heads/main/install.zsh | zsh
```

Both commands will copy the theme code onto your machine, update .zshrc file to connect it and launch it. If you don't see the result, reboot your terminal.
